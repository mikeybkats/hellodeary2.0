          <h2>About</h2>
          <p class="sub-title">For about ten years I was simply someone who dabbled in web technologies. Most of my life Iâ€™ve been an artist. I make music, sketch, paint, construct things out of wood. I also design and make bags, accessories and shoes. I have had a lifelong desire to code, starting in high school where I had a few friends who were making stuff in C++ and I just was really impressed by that. In 2016 I started at Codefellows. There, I learned to take problems one small bite at a time. And, as a very new developer this philosophy gives me confidence and the ability to tackle a wide range of different projects</p>
